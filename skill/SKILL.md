  Mechanically check that a set of facts and constraints is logically consistent
  — instead of trusting your own long chain of reasoning. Reach for it ANY time
  correctness depends on a web of interacting conditions that are easy to get
  subtly wrong, in logic OR in code: role/shift/seat assignments, "exactly one
  of", mutually-exclusive states or feature flags, readiness/deploy gates,
  if/else and state-machine branch coverage, access-control rules,
  dependency/ordering constraints, config invariants, permission matrices, or
  multi-step logic puzzles. You write facts and first principles in a tiny
  English-like DSL; the elenchus engine (a three-valued SAT checker) does the
  logic and answers CONSISTENT / WARNING / UNDERDETERMINED / CONFLICT and shows
  why. Use it to catch contradictions and gaps a hand-derived argument would miss,
  and iterate until it answers CONSISTENT.

# elenchus — a logical-consistency checker

A model is good at stating facts but bad at holding a long logical chain without
quietly contradicting itself. elenchus moves the logic **out** of the model: you
state only **facts** and **first principles (premises)**; a Rust engine does the
inference and finds contradictions mathematically. You can only be wrong at the
premise level — and that is caught immediately.

**What it is:** a simplified SAT (boolean *satisfiability*) checker. Given a pile
of TRUE/FALSE constraints it finds an assignment satisfying all of them, or proves
none exists. elenchus adds a third truth value, **UNKNOWN**, and reports a verdict
instead of a raw sat/unsat. It does **not** do arithmetic or proofs about numbers
(that is SMT, a bigger tool) — only boolean structure.

> **This file is the whole language.** Every keyword and form is listed below.
> **If a construct is not described here, it does not exist** — there are no
> parentheses, no operators inside a name, no nesting, no arithmetic. When you
> need something the language lacks, model it as boolean atoms (see "What does
> not exist").

## The loop — this is the point

Running once is not the job. The verdict tells you what to do next; you iterate
until it is **CONSISTENT**.

```
   write facts + premises ─▶ run ─▶ CONSISTENT?  ── yes ─▶ done (exit 0)
            ▲                         │ no
            │                         ▼
            └──── add facts / fix or rethink a premise ◀── read the verdict
```

| Verdict | exit | Meaning | Your next move |
|--------|:----:|---------|----------------|
| **CONSISTENT** | 0 | no contradiction; answer pinned down | done |
| **WARNING** | 1 | a premise can't be checked — a needed atom is UNKNOWN | add the `FACT`/`NOT` it names under `blocked by:` |
| **UNDERDETERMINED** | 1 | satisfiable, but several models fit | add the fact it suggests (`pin it down: add …`) |
| **CONFLICT** | 2 | a premise is violated, or premises are jointly unsatisfiable | a fact is wrong, or two principles can't both hold — fix one |

**The target before you act on the reasoning is `CONSISTENT` (exit 0) — nothing
else.** WARNING, UNDERDETERMINED and CONFLICT are *not* "done"; each is the engine
telling you exactly what is missing or wrong (see the "Your next move" column).
Treat any non-zero verdict as "keep going", not as a result to report.

**But `CONSISTENT` is only as good as what you fed it.** It certifies "no
contradiction *among the facts and premises you wrote*" — it cannot vouch for a
constraint you never stated. A CONSISTENT verdict on an under-specified model is
false confidence. So:

- **Before the first run, account for everything:** encode every genuine first
  principle as a `PREMISE` (mutual exclusions, "exactly one of", required-together
  gates, orderings, branch coverage) and state every fact you actually know. A
  missing premise = the engine will happily say CONSISTENT about a broken model.
- **Reach CONSISTENT by stating more truth, never by gaming the check** — don't
  delete a valid premise or assert something you don't know just to turn it green;
  that throws away the very check you wanted. If you genuinely don't know a fact,
  that uncertainty *is* the finding.

So "done" = **CONSISTENT with every real premise present and every known fact
stated** — no remaining "but…". Only then trust the reasoning and proceed.

## Keyword reference (the complete set)

Keywords are **ALWAYS CAPS, ASCII**. Everything else is your content.

| Keyword | Where | One-line meaning |
|---------|-------|------------------|
| `FACT` | statement | assert an atom TRUE |
| `NOT` | statement / literal prefix | assert an atom FALSE (or negate a literal in a body) |
| `PREMISE` | statement | a **checked** first principle (violation → CONFLICT) |
| `RULE` | statement | an implication that **derives** new facts (forward chaining) |
| `CHECK` | statement | run the engine (optionally for one subject) |
| `BIDIRECTIONAL` | `CHECK` modifier | also run the backward SAT pass (finds UNDERDETERMINED + joint-unsat) |
| `IMPORT` | statement | flat-merge another `.vrf` source (atoms unify by identity) |
| `EXCLUSIVE` | `PREMISE` body | **at most one** of the listed atoms is TRUE |
| `FORBIDS` | `PREMISE` body | synonym of `EXCLUSIVE` (reads well for two: "not both") |
| `ONEOF` | `PREMISE` body | **exactly one** of the listed atoms is TRUE |
| `ATLEAST` | `PREMISE` body | **at least one** of the listed atoms is TRUE |
| `WHEN` | `PREMISE`/`RULE` body | starts the antecedent of an implication |
| `THEN` | `PREMISE`/`RULE` body | starts the consequent |
| `AND` | `WHEN`/`THEN` group | conjunction of literals in that group |
| `OR` | `WHEN`/`THEN` group | disjunction of literals in that group |
| `//` | anywhere | line comment (to end of line) |

The line-oriented rules that hold everywhere: **one statement per line** (newlines
separate them); **indentation and extra spaces are cosmetic**; an **atom** is two
or three space-separated identifiers `subject predicate [object]`; a **literal** is
an atom optionally prefixed with `NOT`.

## Each keyword: syntax · why · mini-example

### `FACT` / `NOT` — confident facts
- **Syntax:** `FACT <subject> <predicate> [<object>]` · `NOT <subject> <predicate> [<object>]`
- **Why:** the only way to assert truth. `FACT` = TRUE, `NOT` = FALSE. An atom you
  never mention is **UNKNOWN** (not false — the engine never guesses).
```vrf
FACT socrates is human
NOT  socrates is robot
```

### `PREMISE` — a checked first principle
- **Syntax:** `PREMISE <name>:` then a body on the following lines (a list body or
  a `WHEN…THEN` body). `<name>` is a label for the report only.
- **Why:** premises are the constraints elenchus checks. A violated premise is a
  CONFLICT. (See the body keywords below.)
```vrf
PREMISE one_state:
    ONEOF
        door is open
        door is closed
```

### `EXCLUSIVE` / `FORBIDS` — at most one
- **Syntax:** the keyword on its own line, then **≥2 atoms**, one per line.
- **Why:** mutual exclusion. For n>2 it means pairwise "no two together", not
  "not all at once". `FORBIDS` is the same rule, nicer for a pair.
```vrf
PREMISE one_path:
    EXCLUSIVE
        motor uses fast_path
        motor uses slow_path
```

### `ONEOF` — exactly one
- **Syntax:** keyword line, then ≥2 atoms.
- **Why:** at most one **and** at least one is TRUE. The workhorse for assignment
  ("each person has exactly one role").
```vrf
PREMISE alice_role:
    ONEOF
        alice is lead
        alice is dev
        alice is qa
```

### `ATLEAST` — at least one
- **Syntax:** keyword line, then ≥2 atoms.
- **Why:** a disjunction with no upper bound ("at least one reviewer").
```vrf
PREMISE has_reviewer:
    ATLEAST
        pr reviewed_by_ann
        pr reviewed_by_bob
```

### `WHEN … THEN …` — implication (with `AND` / `OR`)
- **Syntax:** `WHEN <lit>` then zero or more `AND <lit>` **or** `OR <lit>` lines,
  then `THEN <lit>` then zero or more `AND`/`OR` lines. Each literal is `[NOT] atom`.
- **Why:** "if the antecedent holds, the consequent must hold". As a `PREMISE` a
  violation is a CONFLICT. **One group may not mix `AND` and `OR`** (split it into
  two premises).
- **The four combinations:**
  - `AND` antecedent / single `THEN`: `a ∧ b → c`
  - `OR` antecedent: `(a ∨ b) → c` (fires if *either* holds)
  - `OR` consequent: `a → (c ∨ d)` (at least one of c/d must hold)
  - both: `(a ∨ b) → (c ∨ d)`
```vrf
PREMISE deploy_gate:
    WHEN svc built
    AND  svc tested
    THEN svc deployable

PREMISE needs_a_backend:
    WHEN gateway in_prod
    THEN auth in_staging
    OR   api in_staging
```

### `RULE` — derive new facts
- **Syntax:** `RULE <name>:` then a `WHEN…THEN` body (a list body is **not**
  allowed here).
- **Why:** unlike `PREMISE` (which only checks), a `RULE` *asserts* its consequent
  as a new TRUE/FALSE fact when the antecedent holds (forward chaining). `OR` in a
  `RULE`'s `THEN` is **rejected** — a rule cannot derive "one of these"; use a
  `PREMISE` for a disjunctive consequent. (`OR` in a rule's `WHEN` is fine.)
```vrf
RULE flyers_breathe:
    WHEN bird can_fly
    THEN bird needs_oxygen
```

### `CHECK` / `BIDIRECTIONAL` — run it
- **Syntax:** `CHECK` · `CHECK <subject>` · `CHECK [<subject>] BIDIRECTIONAL`.
- **Why:** runs the engine. A bare `CHECK` checks everything; a subject restricts
  the report. **`BIDIRECTIONAL`** adds the backward SAT pass: it reports
  **UNDERDETERMINED** when more than one model fits, and catches a **CONFLICT**
  where premises are jointly unsatisfiable even though no single one is visibly
  violated (printing a `CORE`). Use it when you care "is the answer *unique*?".
```vrf
CHECK alice BIDIRECTIONAL
```

### `IMPORT` — reuse another source
- **Syntax:** `IMPORT "<path>"` (quoted path).
- **Why:** flat-merges another `.vrf` file. Think **linker**, not function import:
  files link through **shared atoms** — `Engine.X has fuel` is the same atom
  everywhere, so an imported premise constrains your local facts about that atom.
  Premise *names* are per-source labels (no clash, never referenced). Imports
  compose by **AND**; a genuine disagreement (`a→b` vs `a→¬b`) is a real CONFLICT.
  **`IMPORT` only resolves in file mode** (not `--text`/stdin).
```vrf
IMPORT "physics.vrf"
FACT motor over_100
```

### `//` — comments
- **Syntax:** `//` to end of line (own line or trailing).
```vrf
FACT a b   // a trailing note
```

## Atoms & identity — the #1 gotcha

An **atom** is the triple `(subject, predicate, object?)` and is compared
**verbatim, case-sensitively**. Identifiers may use letters of **any script**
(`условие`, `名前` are fine), then letters/digits/`_`/`.`; they can't start with a
digit or equal a keyword.

`has_fuel` ≠ `hasFuel` ≠ `Has_fuel`, and crucially **`is rolled_back` (two words)
≠ `is_rolled_back` (one word)** — `_`-vs-space changes which token is predicate vs
object, so they are *different atoms*. A typo silently makes a new UNKNOWN atom, so
the constraint you thought you wrote never fires. **Before each run, pick one
spelling per concept and make every name that should be one atom byte-identical.**

The engine helps: it emits advisory **`HINT`** lines (JSON: `hints`) when two names
look like the same atom typed two ways. A `HINT` **never changes the verdict or
exit code** — it's a nudge: fix the spelling if they should be one atom, ignore it
if they're genuinely different.

## What does NOT exist (model it as booleans)

If you reach for any of these, the parser will reject it or, worse, silently
misread it. There is **no**:

- **arithmetic or comparisons** (`>=`, `+`, numbers as math) → turn a threshold
  into a named atom: `speed >= 100` becomes the atom `motor over_100`, and you
  reason about the branch. Order them with a premise: `WHEN motor over_200 THEN
  motor over_100`.
- **operators or `OR`/`AND` *inside* a literal**, and **no parentheses** → group
  logic across `WHEN`/`THEN` lines instead.
- **mixing `AND` and `OR` in one group** → split into separate premises.
- **`OR` in a `RULE`'s `THEN`** → use a `PREMISE` (a rule can't derive a disjunction).
- **quantifiers** (∀/∃), **probabilities**, **nesting**, **else/default branches**.
- list bodies don't take `NOT` items; negate in `WHEN…THEN` bodies via `NOT <atom>`.

## Reading the report

- **`why:` trace** (on a violated premise): the derivation chain that forced the
  clashing atoms — supporting facts first, then each rule built on them — so you
  see the exact wrong step. Present in human output and JSON (`trace`).
- **`CORE`** (on a jointly-unsatisfiable system, found by `BIDIRECTIONAL`): the
  smallest set of premises/facts jointly to blame (JSON `unsat_core`).
- **`HINT`** (advisory): possible atom-name typos (JSON `hints`). Never affects the
  verdict.
- **exit code** = the verdict (0/1/1/2) — a ready CI gate.

## Worked examples — easy → hard

### 1. The smallest contradiction
```vrf
FACT x a
NOT  x a
CHECK x
```
`CONFLICT` (exit 2): the same atom can't be TRUE and FALSE.

### 2. Exactly-one assignment
```vrf
PREMISE alice_role:
    ONEOF
        alice is lead
        alice is dev
        alice is qa
FACT alice is lead
CHECK alice
```
`CONSISTENT`. Assert a second role (`FACT alice is dev`) → `CONFLICT`.

### 3. A gate — iterate WARNING → CONSISTENT
```vrf
FACT svc built
PREMISE ready:
    WHEN svc built
    AND  svc tested
    THEN svc deployable
CHECK svc
```
`WARNING` (`blocked by: svc tested`). Add `FACT svc tested` and `FACT svc
deployable` → `CONSISTENT`. Add `FACT svc tested` but `NOT svc deployable` →
`CONFLICT` (the premise fires and is violated).

### 4. Disjunction — `OR` in `THEN`
```vrf
PREMISE needs_backend:
    WHEN gateway in_prod
    THEN auth in_staging
    OR   api in_staging
FACT gateway in_prod
NOT  auth in_staging
NOT  api in_staging
CHECK
```
`CONFLICT` — the gate fires but every backend is out of staging. Set any one to
`FACT … in_staging` → `CONSISTENT`. (`WHEN a OR b THEN c` mirrors this on the left:
it fires when *either* trigger holds.)

### 5. Derivation + branch coverage (`RULE` + `EXCLUSIVE`)
```vrf
FACT motor over_100
RULE pick_fast:
    WHEN motor over_100
    THEN motor uses fast_path
RULE pick_slow:
    WHEN NOT motor over_100
    THEN motor uses slow_path
PREMISE one_path:
    EXCLUSIVE
        motor uses fast_path
        motor uses slow_path
CHECK motor
```
`CONSISTENT` (derives `uses fast_path`). If your logic could ever take both paths,
`one_path` reports `CONFLICT` — a branch bug caught structurally.

### 6. Jointly-unsatisfiable — only `BIDIRECTIONAL` finds it
```vrf
PREMISE a_to_b:
    WHEN x a
    THEN x b
PREMISE a_to_not_b:
    WHEN x a
    THEN NOT x b
PREMISE need_a_or_c:
    ATLEAST
        x a
        x c
PREMISE c_to_a:
    WHEN x c
    THEN x a
CHECK x BIDIRECTIONAL
```
No single clause is visibly violated (all UNKNOWN), but the premises can't all hold
(c→a→both b and ¬b). elenchus reports `CONFLICT` and prints a `CORE` naming the
four premises jointly to blame.

### 7. Reuse via `IMPORT`
```vrf
// physics.vrf provides: PREMISE fast_xor_slow (EXCLUSIVE motor uses fast_path / slow_path)
IMPORT "physics.vrf"
FACT motor uses fast_path
FACT motor uses slow_path
CHECK motor
```
`CONFLICT` — your local facts violate the imported premise, because both files
share the atoms `motor uses fast_path` / `slow_path`. (`IMPORT` needs file mode.)

## Run it — do these three steps first, in order (every session)

Before you write a single program, set up and verify the engine. Do **not** skip
ahead and start checking logic — an unconfirmed or mismatched engine makes every
later result untrustworthy.

### Step 0a — pick your transport (CLI **or** MCP)

You have exactly one of two ways in. Detect which:

- **Shell available →** use the **CLI** (the `elenchus` binary).
  - `elenchus program.vrf` — check a file (the only mode where `IMPORT` resolves).
  - `elenchus --text "FACT x a\nCHECK x"` — inline (newlines required between lines).
  - `cat program.vrf | elenchus` — stdin. `--format json` for machine output.
- **No shell, but your tools include `elenchus_check` →** use **MCP**. Call
  `elenchus_check` with `{ "program": "<.vrf text>", "format": "json" }`
  (`\n`-separated lines; one source, so no `IMPORT` — inline the premises). The
  server also has `elenchus_version` and `elenchus_about`.
- **Neither →** elenchus is **not installed here**. Stop and send the user to
  **https://github.com/m62624/elenchus** to install it (how depends on their
  CLI/harness). Do **not** fabricate verdicts — if you can't run it, say so.

### Step 0b — smoke-test the transport you picked

Prove at least one transport actually runs before trusting anything. Run the
known-CONFLICT program and confirm the result:

- **CLI:** `elenchus --text "FACT x a\nNOT x a\nCHECK x"` → expect **CONFLICT**, exit **2**.
- **MCP:** `elenchus_check` with `{"program":"FACT x a\nNOT x a\nCHECK x"}` → `status` == `"CONFLICT"`.

Any other answer means the install is broken — fix that before continuing.

### Step 0c — version check (MANDATORY; on ANY mismatch, STOP)

This skill targets the version in the marker below. Read the engine's version and
**print one explicit line** comparing them — never just note it silently:

```
elenchus version check: skill <marker> vs engine <reported> → OK | MISMATCH
```

<!-- skill-version: 0.5.0 -->

- **CLI:** `elenchus --version` (or `-V`) → `elenchus x.y.z`.
- **MCP:** call `elenchus_version` → `elenchus x.y.z` (you can't see
  `initialize`'s `serverInfo.version`, so use this tool).

**If engine == marker** → print `→ OK` and proceed.

**If they differ in ANY way — it does not matter which side is newer or older —
then the functionality the skill describes and the functionality the binary
provides have diverged, so any result may be wrong. Do ALL of this:**

1. **STOP.** Do not run the user's actual task. Abort the current execution.
2. **Immediately emit this warning to the user:** *"⚠️ elenchus version mismatch:
   this skill targets `X` but the installed engine reports `Y`. They describe
   different functionality — one of them must be updated to match the other
   (update the elenchus binary, or update this skill) for compatibility. Update
   from https://github.com/m62624/elenchus."*
3. This warning is **advisory for the user** — but for **you (the model) it is a
   hard stop**: do **not** rationalize it as "probably fine". **Ask the user to
   explicitly confirm** whether to proceed anyway, and make clear that **any
   results produced under a version mismatch may be unreliable / not at the
   correct level**, because the engine's behaviour may not match what this skill
   assumes.
4. Proceed **only if the user explicitly says to continue**. If they do, tag every
   result *"unverified — version mismatch"* until the versions are aligned.
